## Our Vision

We envision a world where cities and organizations can easily harness the power of IoT data to improve services, optimize operations, and enhance quality of life. SematX makes this vision achievable by removing the complexity traditionally associated with IoT platforms.

## The SematX Ecosystem

The SematX ecosystem consists of three main components working together:

### 1. Orion-LD Context Broker

The heart of the SematX platform is the **Orion-LD Context Broker** - an implementation of the FIWARE NGSI-LD standard. This component:

- Stores and manages all IoT entity data
- Provides powerful query and subscription APIs
- Ensures data persistence and reliability
- Handles temporal data for historical analysis

### 2. Orion Nginx Gateway

The **Orion Nginx Gateway** acts as the intelligent front door to your data:

- Provides secure API access with JWT authentication
- Routes requests to the appropriate backend services
- Enforces access control and rate limiting
- Delivers high-performance request handling

### 3. Lego Dashboard

The **Lego Dashboard** is your visual interface to the SematX platform:

- Drag-and-drop dashboard builder for visualizing data
- Entity management interface for CRUD operations
- API key management for secure integrations
- Real-time data subscriptions and webhooks
- User and access control management
